  <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>To answer the initial question of, “what does it mean for me to capture images and create graphics” requires a lil bit of internal reflection. So, you ask me “Marc, why do you take photos?” or “Marc, did you create this graphic? What’s the process?” To answer, I don’t really know. I work based on a feeling and whatever is processing at the moment. For photography, I shoot things that click in my head. If it’s street photography, it’s whatever I thought looked sick at the moment. If it’s a person, I shoot to capture their inner essence. The candid and unintentional is what I strive for. For graphics, it’s just the nostalgia from early childhood that I work off of. There’s a specific brand I’ve kept a close eye on, Somar, that integrates their fashion promos with early 2000s video games (i.e. Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, etc.). I grew up with such things, and when I first started making graphics (in a graphic arts and visual design course in HS) that was what my work was based off of. “Nostalgia”.
There’s a quote from the reading that I resonated with. “To collect photographs is to collect the world.” I connect with that because I tend to capture whatever the world throws at me in that moment, not just anything that many people fall victim to. The idea of photography being to put yourself in relation to the world around you, and realizing that images aren’t statements but are pieces of the world. That relationship is what makes photography so unique. 
A section within the reading that stood out to me entails how Photography itself seems to be a social rite as a weapon against anxiety and a symbol of power. People take time out of their day to step out of their comfort zones, aim their cameras at something they find interesting, and shoot. Now obviously this was seen within recent times as cameras became more accessible to regular everyday people, versus being associated with the rich and uncommon. Cameras go with people on their vacations to capture moments that are considered “unforgettable”. The reading addresses an argument against this. This activity, multiplied across millions of other people doing the same thing, devalues photography as an art form. To add to this, it seems almost “unnatural” to leave your home without the camera if you’re traveling. The counter to this argument is simply that this form of photography is just capturing what is REAL. It’s almost a form of work outside of work that people are happily putting their effort into. “Traveling becomes a strategy for accumulating souvenirs.”
Another thing that stood out to me that meant quite a bit was the comparison of a Camera to a Weapon. Specific notions to this could be like how we “aim” the camera at what we’re looking at, and how we “shoot” to capture what we’re seeing. It’s almost seen as predatory in a sense. We violate personal space by capturing images of strangers. As a camera is directed as a gun, the idea of shooting the camera is almost like a direct nod to murder.

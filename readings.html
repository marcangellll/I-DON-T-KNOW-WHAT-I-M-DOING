  <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>To answer the initial question of, “what does it mean for me to capture images and create graphics” requires a lil bit of internal reflection. So, you ask me “Marc, why do you take photos?” or “Marc, did you create this graphic? What’s the process?” To answer, I don’t really know. I work based on a feeling and whatever is processing at the moment. For photography, I shoot things that click in my head. If it’s street photography, it’s whatever I thought looked sick at the moment. If it’s a person, I shoot to capture their inner essence. The candid and unintentional is what I strive for. For graphics, it’s just the nostalgia from early childhood that I work off of. There’s a specific brand I’ve kept a close eye on, Somar, that integrates their fashion promos with early 2000s video games (i.e. Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, etc.). I grew up with such things, and when I first started making graphics (in a graphic arts and visual design course in HS) that was what my work was based off of. “Nostalgia”.
There’s a quote from the reading that I resonated with. “To collect photographs is to collect the world.” I connect with that because I tend to capture whatever the world throws at me in that moment, not just anything that many people fall victim to. The idea of photography being to put yourself in relation to the world around you, and realizing that images aren’t statements but are pieces of the world. That relationship is what makes photography so unique. 
A section within the reading that stood out to me entails how Photography itself seems to be a social rite as a weapon against anxiety and a symbol of power. People take time out of their day to step out of their comfort zones, aim their cameras at something they find interesting, and shoot. Now obviously this was seen within recent times as cameras became more accessible to regular everyday people, versus being associated with the rich and uncommon. Cameras go with people on their vacations to capture moments that are considered “unforgettable”. The reading addresses an argument against this. This activity, multiplied across millions of other people doing the same thing, devalues photography as an art form. To add to this, it seems almost “unnatural” to leave your home without the camera if you’re traveling. The counter to this argument is simply that this form of photography is just capturing what is REAL. It’s almost a form of work outside of work that people are happily putting their effort into. “Traveling becomes a strategy for accumulating souvenirs.”
Another thing that stood out to me that meant quite a bit was the comparison of a Camera to a Weapon. Specific notions to this could be like how we “aim” the camera at what we’re looking at, and how we “shoot” to capture what we’re seeing. It’s almost seen as predatory in a sense. We violate personal space by capturing images of strangers. As a camera is directed as a gun, the idea of shooting the camera is almost like a direct nod to murder.

  <h2>Nesrine Malik on AI Slop</h2>
  <p>Nesrine Malik’s article, “With ‘AI lop’ Distorting Our Reality, The World is Sleepwalking into Disaster, opens readers’ eyes to our world that’s currently being infested with AI garbage. The article starts off with pointing out two of the main components that take up our daily visual consumption. One of which is real, human made pictures and footage that encompasses politics, sports, entertainment, etc. The other component being “AI Slop”. Garbage that’s seemingly harmless on the surface, which creates false realities using generated images of celebrities, politicians, and even fantasy animals that have been distorted beyond our own recognition. Because AI has become so advanced, it’s impossible to distinguish between what’s real and what is false generated reality. AI usage has no longer blurred the lines between the two, it’s distorted it. We’ve seen right-wing politicians and groups use AI to pervert the political climate by what is shared on social media and messaging apps such as Whatsapp. Going on Twitter myself, I’ve seen American groups such as Homeland Security and The White House creating AI garbage to spin a narrative. To create these disgusting political cartoons in order to better their own running in our current political climate. For example, The White House posted an AI generated cartoon (using a Studio Ghibli art style) to depict a Dominican woman in tears being arrested by ICE. Malike made the point that with AI, there’s an infinite amount of scenarios that AI can create that surpass what’s achievable in our reality. I would say that I actually agree with this point. In 2025, we’ve seen AI go from simple and terrible image generators that couldn’t do much, to incredibly realistic AI models that can create scarily real images and videos of real people in weird scenarios. Granted, I can say that it’s easy to distinguish between what’s real and what’s false reality. However, older generations (and younger, depending on how media literate these generations choose to be) tend to fall victim and believe these scary AI slop videos. The most specific example of an AI model I can think of is the Sora AI model. I’ve seen countless videos of real celebrities or people being put in strange scenarios that range from realistic to unrealistic. One video I can recall is of a police officer pulling over a cat in a car for speeding. Now this may seem harmless, but because of how good the model has become, many people can fall victim to believing what they’re viewing. Considering how social media applications like Instagram and X’s algorithms are run, they push their users towards AI garbage for a good majority of what they see. Youtube has been running unskippable ads that have been pumped out by companies using AI, such as gambling websites that promote gambling to many unsuspecting viewers.</p>

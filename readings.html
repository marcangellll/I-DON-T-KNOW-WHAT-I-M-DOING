  <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p>To answer the initial question of, “what does it mean for me to capture images and create graphics” requires a lil bit of internal reflection. So, you ask me “Marc, why do you take photos?” or “Marc, did you create this graphic? What’s the process?” To answer, I don’t really know. I work based on a feeling and whatever is processing at the moment. For photography, I shoot things that click in my head. If it’s street photography, it’s whatever I thought looked sick at the moment. If it’s a person, I shoot to capture their inner essence. The candid and unintentional is what I strive for. For graphics, it’s just the nostalgia from early childhood that I work off of. There’s a specific brand I’ve kept a close eye on, Somar, that integrates their fashion promos with early 2000s video games (i.e. Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, etc.). I grew up with such things, and when I first started making graphics (in a graphic arts and visual design course in HS) that was what my work was based off of. “Nostalgia”.
There’s a quote from the reading that I resonated with. “To collect photographs is to collect the world.” I connect with that because I tend to capture whatever the world throws at me in that moment, not just anything that many people fall victim to. The idea of photography being to put yourself in relation to the world around you, and realizing that images aren’t statements but are pieces of the world. That relationship is what makes photography so unique. 
A section within the reading that stood out to me entails how Photography itself seems to be a social rite as a weapon against anxiety and a symbol of power. People take time out of their day to step out of their comfort zones, aim their cameras at something they find interesting, and shoot. Now obviously this was seen within recent times as cameras became more accessible to regular everyday people, versus being associated with the rich and uncommon. Cameras go with people on their vacations to capture moments that are considered “unforgettable”. The reading addresses an argument against this. This activity, multiplied across millions of other people doing the same thing, devalues photography as an art form. To add to this, it seems almost “unnatural” to leave your home without the camera if you’re traveling. The counter to this argument is simply that this form of photography is just capturing what is REAL. It’s almost a form of work outside of work that people are happily putting their effort into. “Traveling becomes a strategy for accumulating souvenirs.”
Another thing that stood out to me that meant quite a bit was the comparison of a Camera to a Weapon. Specific notions to this could be like how we “aim” the camera at what we’re looking at, and how we “shoot” to capture what we’re seeing. It’s almost seen as predatory in a sense. We violate personal space by capturing images of strangers. As a camera is directed as a gun, the idea of shooting the camera is almost like a direct nod to murder.

  <h2>Nesrine Malik on AI Slop</h2>
  <p>Nesrine Malik’s article, “With ‘AI lop’ Distorting Our Reality, The World is Sleepwalking into Disaster, opens readers’ eyes to our world that’s currently being infested with AI garbage. The article starts off with pointing out two of the main components that take up our daily visual consumption. One of which is real, human made pictures and footage that encompasses politics, sports, entertainment, etc. The other component being “AI Slop”. Garbage that’s seemingly harmless on the surface, which creates false realities using generated images of celebrities, politicians, and even fantasy animals that have been distorted beyond our own recognition. Because AI has become so advanced, it’s impossible to distinguish between what’s real and what is false generated reality. AI usage has no longer blurred the lines between the two, it’s distorted it. We’ve seen right-wing politicians and groups use AI to pervert the political climate by what is shared on social media and messaging apps such as Whatsapp. Going on Twitter myself, I’ve seen American groups such as Homeland Security and The White House creating AI garbage to spin a narrative. To create these disgusting political cartoons in order to better their own running in our current political climate. For example, The White House posted an AI generated cartoon (using a Studio Ghibli art style) to depict a Dominican woman in tears being arrested by ICE. Malike made the point that with AI, there’s an infinite amount of scenarios that AI can create that surpass what’s achievable in our reality. I would say that I actually agree with this point. In 2025, we’ve seen AI go from simple and terrible image generators that couldn’t do much, to incredibly realistic AI models that can create scarily real images and videos of real people in weird scenarios. Granted, I can say that it’s easy to distinguish between what’s real and what’s false reality. However, older generations (and younger, depending on how media literate these generations choose to be) tend to fall victim and believe these scary AI slop videos. The most specific example of an AI model I can think of is the Sora AI model. I’ve seen countless videos of real celebrities or people being put in strange scenarios that range from realistic to unrealistic. One video I can recall is of a police officer pulling over a cat in a car for speeding. Now this may seem harmless, but because of how good the model has become, many people can fall victim to believing what they’re viewing. Considering how social media applications like Instagram and X’s algorithms are run, they push their users towards AI garbage for a good majority of what they see. Youtube has been running unskippable ads that have been pumped out by companies using AI, such as gambling websites that promote gambling to many unsuspecting viewers.</p>

  <h2>Motherhood in Crisis - Analysis</h2>
  <p>In Chapter 3, “The Devil At My Door”, in the graphic novel series of “Motherhood in Crisis”, the usage of illustration and text combined with photography and video creates a generally easy read. The illustration used in this story (and many others) was used specifically because there may have been a lack of recording through pictures of the events that had occurred. Specifically to these scenarios, the illustration helped for an easy read through the horrible events that Kadiatu had gone through. Those events being the loss of her children due to illness, members of her community openly fearing her, a false doctor not treating her, etc. I believe that the use of illustration eases the viewers (that are presumably in their teens) into reading and uncovering these terrible and sad stories that many people are not aware of, such as stillborn children and losing young members of a family. Many times, people who view photographs of real life scenarios are put off, or made uncomfortable by what they are seeing. It provides less uncomfortability that would mainly come from viewing images. Typically, graphic novels are very easy reads, and can be finished within minutes due to how short they are and how encapsulating the illustrations are (think of many of Marvel’s graphic novels and how they’ve been so consistently successful over the years). Visually, the illustrations are soft and less harsh compared to the photographs. The backgrounds in each story are hand-drawn and add to the gentle nature that illustrating the story provides. As the story progresses, we see more of the backgrounds transitioning to actual photographs of places, until it eventually showcases real life photographs and video testimonials from doctors tying to the story. There’s also more creative freedom that the author and artist can take when illustrating images of a story. We can see the emotions being painted on many of the people’s faces, which helps the reader understand the context behind many of the scenes. Dialogue too, between characters, helps push the story forward alongside the narration text in a black text box. This helps with how interactive the story is, as the reader can have a grasp on what truly went on in these events that pictures could not fully capture. I think that the usage of a graphic novel to convey each of these stories was a well thought out choice. Usually long form essays and articles quickly lose the attention of a younger audience. With this format of story-telling, it’s quite easy to keep the reader entertained and engaged with the serious subject matter at hand, allowing for more awareness and understanding of other cultures and other countries.</p>

  <h2> W.J. Hennigan on Nuclear Conflict</h2>
  <p>W.J. Hennigan’s article on being on the brink of Nuclear War has to have been my favorite read so far. Typically NYT articles are simply formatted, mainly being black text on a simple white background. This article starts off with a title card, sitting eerily against a breathing maroon glow. As you scroll, you see the question being posed to the reader, “Is anyone paying attention?” as the glow grows stronger and eventually gives way to a white screen that brings us into the article. I was in such awe scrolling through this, that I scrolled through it at least 3 times. I found that to be the recurring theme for me as I was reading this article. The combination of graphics alongside the article was very very entertaining, almost like the graphic novel reading that we had to reflect on for Homework 6. The article introduces the main problem at hand; nuclear warfare being a huge risk. Hennigan discusses Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and how Ukraine and the U.S. had been anticipating a sort of nuclear event being declared on Ukraine by Russia. Despite the number of nuclear arms being reduced by both the U.S. and Russia, the threat of Nuclear Warfare still looms over us in the uncertain air. As we as readers scroll down through the article, we’re introduced to a scenario surrounding a nuclear weapon making contact with a country. We see an illustration of said nuclear warhead dropping as we scroll, until eventually it explodes, filling our screen with an orange graphic explosion. Scrolling more gives way to a scorched Earth, destroyed buildings, and even cars that’ve fallen victim to the explosion. At the epicenter of this explosion, we’re looking at the nuclear mushroom as it rains down ash and embers, and changes the sky from orange to red. I think the interactive map showcasing the main powerhouses that hold nuclear arms was a very neat touch. This shows us just how much the global stockpile has increased and decreased as the years pass by (we’re talking pre-Cold War, during the Cold War, and post-Cold War). During one part of this informative article, we’re introduced to a potential statistic that detailed just how catastrophic nuclear warfare would be on the world. Even on a smaller scale, something smaller than global nuclear war, would unleash devastating effects upon millions and millions of people. 27 million people would die immediately, and 255 million would soon follow due to the effects of possibly 100 Hiroshima sized bombs dropped upon certain cities. Throughout the article, we’re introduced to photography, interviews of global leaders, as well as videos showcasing trucks transporting nuclear arms. This creates this unease and tense feeling that the world is feeling with the uncertainty of what’s actually going to happen in the events of a global nuclear war. </p>
